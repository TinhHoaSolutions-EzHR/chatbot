## Milestone 1: Discovery and Planning

- **Goal**: Define project requirements, key objectives, and architecture.
- **Details**:
  - Conduct research on user needs, LLM capabilities, and expected system load.
  - Define project scope, including the primary features and user stories.
  - Outline initial system architecture (frontend, backend, cache, databases).
  - Set up project repository, CI/CD pipelines, and preliminary development environment.
- **Deliverables**: Requirements document, architecture diagram, project timeline, and initial codebase setup.

## Milestone 2: Core Infrastructure Setup

- **Goal**: Establish core infrastructure, including storage, databases, and background processing.
- **Details**:
  - Set up and configure Document Storage (AWS S3 or MinIO), Vector Database (Qdrant), and Relational Database (SQL Server).
  - Configure the background task queue (Celery on AWS Step Functions or similar) for asynchronous tasks like embedding documents.
  - Establish serverless or managed services for storage and databases to reduce costs and improve scalability.
- **Deliverables**: Functional infrastructure with integration tests confirming connectivity and data storage.

## Milestone 3: Prototype Completion

- **Goal**: Develop a functional prototype with basic LLM and embedding model integration.
- **Details**:
  - Integrate the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI API) and embedding model (GPT or PhoBERT) for basic query processing.
  - Build a simple frontend UI (NextJS) for users to submit queries and receive responses.
  - Implement a basic API server (FastAPI on AWS Lambda) with reverse proxy (Nginx).
  - Test end-to-end flow from user input to LLM response and back.
- **Deliverables**: Basic functional prototype enabling user queries and AI-generated responses.

## Milestone 4: Core Features Developed

- **Goal**: Implement essential features like document processing, caching, and vector search.
- **Details**:
  - Implement background tasks for document embedding and storage in the Vector Database.
  - Add caching (Redis) for frequently accessed queries to improve response times.
  - Build vector-based search functionality for finding similar documents based on embeddings.
  - Refine UI and backend to support these features with scalability in mind.
- **Deliverables**: Feature-complete application with document embedding, caching, and search.

## Milestone 5: Alpha Release (Internal Testing)

- **Goal**: Launch an internal version for testing core functionalities and performance.
- **Details**:
  - Deploy to a test environment with restricted access for internal team members.
  - Conduct usability testing for UI, API reliability, and system stability.
  - Run initial performance tests to check if response times and throughput meet expectations.
  - Collect internal feedback to refine UX and resolve major issues.
- **Deliverables**: Stable alpha version with feedback from internal testing and an updated backlog.

## Milestone 6: Beta Release (Limited User Testing)

- **Goal**: Release a beta version for a limited audience to gather real user feedback.
- **Details**:
  - Deploy to a production-like environment with limited access for select users.
  - Implement logging and monitoring to capture usage patterns, errors, and bottlenecks.
